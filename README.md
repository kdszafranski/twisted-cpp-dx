## Maze Generation Notes

### Binary Tree 

The gist of this method is that it's very simple to understand... once you get a concise list of the actual steps involved. Once you have that, it's super simple.

Helpful bit: 

> Most maze generation algorithms require maintaining relationships between cells within it, to ensure the result will be solvable. Valid simply connected mazes can however be generated by focusing on each cell independently. A **binary tree maze** is a standard orthogonal maze where each cell always has a passage leading up or leading left, but never both. To create a **binary tree maze**, for each cell flip a coin to decide whether to add a passage leading up or left. Always pick the same direction for cells on the boundary, and the result will be a valid simply connected maze that looks like a binary tree, with the upper left corner its root. As with Sidewinder, the binary tree maze has no dead ends in the directions of bias.
